\title{Filter and process marker genes from Seurat's FindMarkers or FindAllMarkers results}
\usage{
marker_trim(markers, sign = NULL, p_cutoff = NULL, filter = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{markers}{A data frame from Seurat's FindMarkers or FindAllMarkers results}

\item{sign}{Character string indicating the direction of log fold change to keep.
Options: NULL (keep all), "+" (positive only), "-" (negative only)}

\item{p_cutoff}{Numeric value for adjusted p-value cutoff. Default is NULL (no filtering)}

\item{filter}{Additional filtering criteria (not used in this function)}
}
\value{
A processed data frame with filtered markers and added pct.diff column
}
\description{
This function processes marker gene results by filtering based on log fold change direction,
adjusted p-value cutoff, and adding percentage difference information.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Filter markers to keep only positive log fold changes
markers_positive <- marker_trim(markers, sign = "+")

# Filter markers with adjusted p-value < 0.05
markers_sig <- marker_trim(markers, p_cutoff = 0.05)
}
}
