\title{Create Barcode Mapping from Demultiplexing Data}
\usage{
get_barcode_mapping(demux_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{demux_data}{A data frame containing demultiplexing results. Must have a 'BARCODE'
column and additional columns for sample probabilities}
}
\value{
A data frame containing:
- Barcode: The cell barcode
- Best_Sample: The sample with highest probability
- Best_Probability: The highest probability value
- Second_Best_Sample: The sample with second highest probability
- Second_Best_Probability: The second highest probability value
- Probability_Ratio: Ratio of best to second-best probabilities
}
\description{
This function processes demultiplexing data to create a mapping between barcodes
and their most likely sample assignments, including probability information.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create barcode mapping from demultiplexing results
mapping <- get_barcode_mapping(demux_data)

# Filter for high confidence assignments
high_conf <- mapping[mapping$Probability_Ratio > 2, ]
}
}
